# EPaaS Payment Reconciliation


##  Functional Overview
EPaaS is a Payment Platform offered by the Bank to Third Party Payment Providers (TPPPs). TPPPs use their own APIs that are used to invoke EPaaS APIs, which in-turn execute the Bankâ€™s Payment APIs.

The purpose of the Reconciliation is to ensure that the transactions executed by the TPPP match the transactions executed by the Bank and the EPaaS platform has an always accurate view in order to carry out daily settlement (payment to the TPPP).


### Basic Payment Process

This diagram illustrates the simplified interactions between Merchants, Third-Party Payment Providers (TPPPs), EPaaS, and the Bank during payment process.

```mermaid

    participant Merchant
    participant TPPP
    participant PaymentService as Payment Service
    participant Bank

    Merchant->>TPPP: Initiate Payment Request
    TPPP->>PaymentService: Forward Payment Request
    PaymentService->>Bank: Execute Payment
    Bank-->>PaymentService: Payment Response (Success/Failure)
    PaymentService-->>TPPP: Forward Payment Response
    TPPP-->>Merchant: Notify Payment Status

```


### Reconciliation Workflow
The following diagram represents how a reconciliation process is performed.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Payment Initiator sends payment request] -->|API Call| B[EPaaS Receives Request]
    B -->|Validate Request| C[Store Transaction Record]
    C -->|Invoke Bank Payment API| D[Bank Processes Payment]
    D -->|Response Received| E[Store Response in Reconciliation Record]
    E -->|Match with Original Request| F{Status Match?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Update Reconciliation Status to MATCH]
    F -->|No| H{Exception Type}
    H -->|Source Missing| I[Set Status to UNDER_EXCEPTION]

    H -->|Data Mismatch| K[Set Status to TECHNICAL_EXCEPTION]
    I --> L[Batch Processing at Cutoff Time]

```

### Reconciliation Record Lifecycle
The following diagram depicts the lifecycle of a reconciliation record.

```mermaid

    [*] --> Created
    Created --> RequestLogged : Payment request received
    RequestLogged --> PendingMatching : Awaiting bank response
    PendingMatching --> Matched : Response received & matched
    PendingMatching --> UnderException : Mismatch in data or record missing in source
    PendingMatching --> OverException : Record missing in target
    PendingMatching --> TechnicalException : Data mismatch (excluding status)
    Matched --> Settled : Successfully reconciled
    UnderException --> PendingResolution : Manual review required
    OverException --> PendingResolution : Manual review required
    TechnicalException --> PendingResolution : Manual review required
    PendingResolution --> Settled : Issue resolved
    Settled --> [*]

```

## Technical Design

### Technical Architecture
Here's the high-level view of the solution, depicting the EPaaS Reconciliation System and its interactions with external entities.

![Architecture View](diagrams/architecture.png)

It consists of several key components:
- **Payment API**: Handles incoming payment requests, and sends payment events to the **Payment-Requests topic**. This service also processes transaction responses, that are posted to the **Payment-Responses topic**.
- **Recon API**: Handles incoming reconciliation requests, and sends reconciliation events to the **Recon-Events topic**. This API also manages batch file uploads for on-demand reconciliation, storing files in FileStorage and then sends reconciliation events to the **Recon-Events topic**.
- **Config API**: Handles configuration of reconciliation parameters and other settings such as rate limits.
- **Payment Processor**: Consumes messages from **Payment-Requests topic**, updates the database and dispatches the request to the bank system. If a payment response is received immediately, then it posts a message to the **Recon-Events topic**. This processor also consumes messages from **Payment-Responses topic**. Then updates the database with the payment status and posts a message to the **Recon-Events topic**.
- **Recon Processor**: Performs reconciliation of single events or batches, based on transaction request & response matching.
- **Database**: Stores transaction data (payment requests, responses, and reconciliation records), using PostgreSQL for relational data management. This database also stores audit logs for compliance purposes.
- **File Storage**: Stores batch transaction files on Amazon S3 for scalability.
- **Misc Utils**: Contains utility classes for common operations such as file upload, date utils, audit logging, and error handling.


### Data Model
The following diagram depicts the data model of the Payment and Reconciliation scenarios.

![Data Model](diagrams/datamodel.png)
Ref: https://dbdiagram.io/d/67e9a2954f7afba184bc42ba

The key tables are described below:
- **PAYMENTS**: Stores all the payment details such as the payment ID, bank reference ID, amount, currency, payment method, and the current status of the payment.

- **RECON_BATCHES**: Holds information about reconciliation batch processing, which define the time window during which the reconciliation occurs (start time, end time, batch status).

- **RECONCILIATIONS**: Stores the result of the reconciliation process, which includes the matching status (MATCH, UNDER_EXCEPTION, OVER_EXCEPTION) and any error details if there are exceptions.

- **MERCHANTS**: Represents the merchants who use the EPaaS platform, containing details such as their name, email, and phone number.

- **TPPPS**: Represents the Third-Party Payment Providers (TPPPs) interacting with the platform.


### Tech Stack
- **Microservices:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security
- **Database:** Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)

- **Access Controls:** API key based access control


## API Specifications for EPaaS Reconciliation System
This section outlines the API specifications for the EPaaS (Enterprise Payments as a Service) platform. The APIs are designed to facilitate seamless integration between payment initiators (Third-Party Payment Providers - TPPPs) and the Bank's payment system.

### Payment API (/payment)

This API is invoked by the TPPP APIs to make a payment through EPaaS. It invokes the Bank API in order to perform a payment. Reconciliation flow is triggered if a payment success/failure is received immediately from the Bank. Otherwise, the acknowledgement received from the Bank is forwarded to the TPPP.

    Merchant->>TPPP: Initiate Payment Request
    TPPP->>PaymentAPI: Forward Payment Request
    PaymentAPI->>Kafka: Post to Payment-Request Kafka topic
    Kafka->>PaymentProcessor: Process Payment Event
    PaymentProcessor->>Bank: Execute Payment

    alt Payment Response Received
        PaymentProcessor->>Kafka: Post to Recon-Events Kafka topic

        ReconProcessor->>ReconProcessor: Match Payment Request & Response,<br>Update Reconciliation Status in Database
    end
    PaymentAPI-->>TPPP: Notify Payment Acknowledgement
    TPPP-->>Merchant: Notify Payment Acknowledgement
