# EPaaS Payment Reconciliation


##  Functional Overview
EPaaS is a Payment Platform offered by the Bank to Third Party Payment Providers (TPPPs). TPPPs use their own APIs that are used to invoke EPaaS APIs, which in-turn execute the Bankâ€™s Payment APIs.

The purpose of the Reconciliation is to ensure that the transactions executed by the TPPP match the transactions executed by the Bank and the EPaaS platform has an always accurate view in order to carry out daily settlement (payment to the TPPP).


### Basic Payment Process

This diagram illustrates the basic interactions between Merchants, Third-Party Payment Providers (TPPPs), EPaaS, and the Bank during payment process.

```mermaid

    participant TPPP
    participant PaymentService as Payment Service
    participant Bank

    Merchant->>TPPP: Initiate Payment Request
    TPPP->>PaymentService: Forward Payment Request
    PaymentService->>Bank: Execute Payment
    Bank-->>PaymentService: Payment Response (Success/Failure)
    PaymentService-->>TPPP: Forward Payment Response
    TPPP-->>Merchant: Notify Payment Status

```


### Reconciliation Workflow
The following diagram represents how a reconciliation process is performed.

```mermaid

    A[Payment Initiator sends payment request] -->|API Call| B[EPaaS Receives Request]
    B -->|Validate Request| C[Store Transaction Record]
    C -->|Invoke Bank Payment API| D[Bank Processes Payment]

```


### Reconciliation Record Lifecycle
The following diagram depicts the lifecycle of a reconciliation record.

```mermaid

    [*] --> Created
    Created --> RequestLogged : Payment request received
    RequestLogged --> PendingMatching : Awaiting bank response
    PendingMatching --> Matched : Response received & matched
    PendingMatching --> UnderException : Mismatch in data or record missing in source
    PendingMatching --> OverException : Record missing in target
    PendingMatching --> TechnicalException : Data mismatch (excluding status)
    Matched --> Settled : Successfully reconciled
    UnderException --> PendingResolution : Manual review required
    OverException --> PendingResolution : Manual review required
    TechnicalException --> PendingResolution : Manual review required
    PendingResolution --> Settled : Issue resolved
    Settled --> [*]

## Technical Architecture

### System Context Diagram
Here's the high-level view of the solution, depicting the EPaaS Reconciliation System and its interactions with external entities.
![context diagram](diagrams/context.png)

### Container Diagram
The following diagram depicts the deployable units, such as services, databases, and file storage systems.
![container diagram](diagrams/container.png)
It consists of several key containers:
- **ReconService**: Central service handling configuration, payment request processing, transaction response matching, and batch file uploads.
- **Database**: Stores transaction data (payment requests, responses, and reconciliation records), using PostgreSQL for relational data management. This database will also store audit logs for compliance purposes.
- **FileStorage**: Manages batch transaction files, potentially using local file systems or cloud storage like Amazon S3 for scalability.

### Component Diagram
The following diagram depicts the components of the ReconService, and their interactions with each other and other containers.

![component diagram](diagrams/component.png)
It consists of several key components:
- **ConfigurationManager**: Manages batch schedules and configuration, interacting with the Database.
- **PaymentProcessor**: Handles incoming payment requests, storing them in the Database. Also processes transaction responses, updating statuses in the Database.
- **FileUploader**: Manages batch file uploads, storing files in FileStorage and notifying the ReconEngine.
- **ReconEngine**: Performs reconciliation, retrieving data from Database and FileStorage, and updating statuses.

### Data Model
The following diagram depicts the data model of the Payment and Reconciliation scenarios.

![Data Model](diagrams/datamodel.png)

The key tables are described below:
- **payments**: Stores all the payment details such as the payment ID, bank reference ID, amount, currency, payment method, and the current status of the payment.

- **recon_batches**: Holds information about reconciliation batch processing, which define the time window during which the reconciliation occurs (start time, end time, batch status).

- **reconciliations**: Stores the result of the reconciliation process, which includes the matching status (MATCH, UNDER_EXCEPTION, OVER_EXCEPTION) and any error details if there are exceptions.

- **merchants**: Represents the merchants who use the EPaaS platform, containing details such as their name, email, and phone number.

- **tppps**: Represents the Third-Party Payment Providers (TPPPs) interacting with the platform.

### Batch Reconciliation Process
Reconciliation is performed immediately upon receiving payment response from the Bank.
This diagram illustrates the API interactions between Merchants, Third-Party Payment Providers (TPPPs), EPaaS, and the Bank during batch reconciliation process.

```mermaid

    participant Merchant
    participant TPPP
    participant ReconService as Reconciliation Service
    participant Bank

    Merchant->>TPPP: Upload Reconciliation Batch File
    TPPP->>ReconService: Forward Batch File
    ReconService->>Bank: Fetch Bank Transactions for Batch Period
    Bank-->>ReconService: Bank's Transaction Records
    ReconService->>ReconService: Match Transactions & Compute Status
    ReconService-->>TPPP: Send Reconciliation Results
    TPPP-->>Merchant: Notify Reconciliation Status

```


## API Specifications for EPaaS Reconciliation System
This section outlines the API specifications for the EPaaS (Enterprise Payments as a Service) platform. The APIs are designed to facilitate seamless integration between payment initiators (Third-Party Payment Providers - TPPPs) and the Bank's payment system.

### PaymentService (/payment)

This API is invoked by the TPPP APIs to make a payment through EPaaS. It invokes the Bank API in order to perform a payment. Reconciliation is triggered if a payment success/failure is received immediately from the Bank. Otherwise, the acknowledgement received from the Bank is forwarded to the TPPP.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Merchant
    participant TPPP
    participant PaymentService as Payment Service
    participant ReconService as Reconciliation Service
    participant Bank

    Merchant->>TPPP: Initiate Payment Request
    TPPP->>PaymentService: Forward Payment Request
    PaymentService->>Bank: Execute Payment
    Bank-->>PaymentService: Payment Response (Success/Failure/Acknowledgement)
    alt Payment Response Received
        PaymentService->>ReconService: Send Payment Request & Response Data
        ReconService->>ReconService: Match Payment Request & Response
        ReconService->>ReconService: Update Reconciliation Status
        PaymentService-->>TPPP: Forward Payment Response & Reconciliation Status
        TPPP-->>Merchant: Notify Payment Status & Reconciliation Status
    else Payment Response Not Received
        PaymentService-->>TPPP: Forward Acknowledgement
        TPPP-->>Merchant: Notify Payment Acknowledgement
    end
```
